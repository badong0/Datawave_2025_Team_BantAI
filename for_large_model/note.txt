Due to the training, this pkl result is from the initial raw training phase. It will be reduced and optimized as the pkl is enhanced

for production use.



note!!!!

paste this on the training part of the code to adjust if wanted to reduce the estimators

# Reduce model complexity
clf = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=50,  # Instead of 200
    max_depth=10,     # Limit tree depth
    random_state=42
)

# Use pickle instead of joblib
import pickle
with open('bantai_model_optimized.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump({
        "model": clf, 
        "scaler": self.scaler, 
        "features": self.ml_feature_columns
    }, f)
